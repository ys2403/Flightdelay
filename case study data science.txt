Objective: 
We are a travel app development company looking to add an intelligent feature that helps users make informed decisions about flight delays. You are tasked to build an end-to-end machine learning solution that predicts flight delays and provides actionable insights to travelers.

Tasks:

1)	Data Exploration & Analysis
    - Perform comprehensive exploratory data analysis
    - Identify patterns, trends, and anomalies in the dataset
    - Engineer meaningful features that could improve prediction accuracy
    - Provide code and visualizations with detailed explanations

2)	Machine Learning Model Development
    - Develop at least two different predictive models using appropriate algorithms
    - Define your target variable and explain your labeling strategy
    - Implement proper data preprocessing and feature engineering techniques
    - Apply best practices for model training and validation

3)	Model Evaluation & Selection
    - Compare model performance using relevant evaluation metrics
    - Justify your choice of metrics based on the business context
    - Provide comprehensive analysis on which model should be adopted
    - Discuss trade-offs between different models

4)	Model Interpretation & Insights
    - Explain the key factors that contribute to flight delay predictions
    - Provide interpretable insights that can be communicated to end users
    - Discuss how these findings can be translated into app features

BONUS (Optional): Advanced Implementation
5)	Deploy an intelligent interface that allows users to interact with your model naturally
    - Consider building conversational AI capabilities for user queries
    - Implement recommendation systems based on predictions
    - Design architecture for real-time prediction services

Deliverable: 
Submit a Jupyter notebook including:
- Complete analysis and explanation for all required tasks
- Well-documented code with markdown explanations
- Visualizations and insights that support your findings
- Clear recommendations for implementation
- (Optional) Additional components for advanced features - you may include extra Python scripts if the notebook alone is insufficient

Note: You have flexibility in your technical approach - choose tools, frameworks, and methodologies that best demonstrate your skills and suit the problem requirements.
